# HunterGame-V1
This project introduce a simple game of hunter and hunted. The hunted player needs to escape the random move directions of the hunter by choosing his own moves(up,down,right,left). As long as the seconds goes the score increase. The player has 3 lives and after using them the game is OVER.

This is the first version of the game:


Each round starts from 0 points and increase by 10 every 1 second
